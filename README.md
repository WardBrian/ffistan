# FFIStan

**FFIStan** (short for *Foreign Function Interface Stan*, alternatively *Fast, Flatiron Institute, Stan*) is a library that
provides a C interface to the [Stan](mc-stan.org) algorithms, such as sampling with the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS).

It is intended to be a counterpart to BridgeStan, which provides a C interface to the methods of a Stan *model*.
